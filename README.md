Task-4

Explanation of this Task:
1. Formulate Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis (H0): No significant difference in click-through rates between the control and treatment groups.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Significant difference in click-through rates between the control and treatment groups.

2. Design Experiment
Sample Size: Determine the number of participants required (e.g., 1000 users per group).
Duration: Specify the duration of the experiment (e.g., 30 days).
Metric: Define the metric to measure (e.g., click-through rate).

3. Randomize and Assign
Random Assignment: Randomly assign participants to either the control group (current ad) or the treatment group (new ad).
Simulated Data: For this example, generate synthetic data to mimic the experiment.

4. Collect Data
Data Collection: Gather the data from both groups. For this example, data is simulated.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize Data: Use bar plots to compare click-through rates between groups.
Replace deprecated parameter ci='sd' with errorbar='sd':
sns.barplot(x='group', y='click', data=data, errorbar='sd')
plt.title('Click-through Rates by Group')
plt.ylabel('Click-through Rate')
plt.show()
Summary Statistics: Calculate mean, standard deviation, and count for each group to understand basic data characteristics.

6. Statistical Analysis
T-test: Perform a two-sample t-test to compare the means of the control and treatment groups.
Null hypothesis: No difference between groups.
P-value: Determines statistical significance.

7. Interpret Results
Statistical Significance: Compare the p-value to the significance level (alpha = 0.05).
If p-value < alpha: Reject the null hypothesis (significant difference).
If p-value â‰¥ alpha: Fail to reject the null hypothesis (no significant difference).

8. Make Recommendations
Recommendation Based on Results:
If the treatment group has a significantly higher click-through rate, recommend implementing the new ad design.
If not, recommend sticking with the current ad design.
Additional Analysis: Effect Size
Cohen's d: Calculate to assess practical significance.
Effect Size Interpretation:
Small (d > 0.2)
Medium (d > 0.5)
Large (d > 0.8
